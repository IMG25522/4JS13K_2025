I was planning to add sound to it when the main part is done, and before that, I decided to try it on JS13K tosee if it works properly.
	And, what happened is I mistakenly **SUBMITTED** it due to my misunderstanding of the instructions......

So that's how you see a 7Kbs Non-Music game here.

But, again, the main fault belongs to me. I haven't explain that this game is viewing one thing in two different point of views,
And I was working on another project (Which is later found to be rejected by CrazyGames) anlong with it, which could make me to think
that I can just make a "playble" project -- which is destructive to creating.

After saying such a bunch of things, I want to say that I am lazy, and completely underestimated the quality a successful game would need.

Apologize to all.
